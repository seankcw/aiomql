**Attributes**:

- `FOK` _int_ - This execution policy means that an order can be executed only in the specified volume. If the necessary amount of a

  The current pending orders are not considered since their execution may lead to changes in the current positions but it cannot increase
  their number.

  positions and pending orders.
