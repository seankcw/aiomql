            operates differently depending on the position accounting type:

            · Netting — number of open positions is considered. When a limit is reached, the platform does not let placing new orders whose execution may
                increase the number of open positions. In fact, the platform allows placing orders only for the symbols that already have open positions.
                The current pending orders are not considered since their execution may lead to changes in the current positions but it cannot increase
                their number.

            · Hedging — pending orders are considered together with open positions, since a pending order activation
                always leads to opening a new position. When a limit is reached, the platform does not allow placing both new market orders for opening
                positions and pending orders.

        REJECT_CANCEL (int): The pending order activation request is rejected, the order is canceled.
